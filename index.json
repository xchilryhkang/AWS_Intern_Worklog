Detailed description of Amazon Bedrock and Foundation Models. Technical guidance on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to build intelligent and accurate AI applications while reducing hallucinations. Introduction to the ecosystem of specialized AI services on AWS. Speakers Lam Tuan Kiet - Sr DevOps Engineer, FPT Software. Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi - AI Engineer, Renova Cloud. Dinh Le Hoang Anh - Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey. Key Highlights The shift: Traditional ML vs Foundation Models Traditional ML Models: Specialized for specific tasks, require labeled data, and need separate training/deployment pipelines for each purpose. Foundation Models (FM): Trained on massive amounts of unstructured data, capable of adapting to various tasks such as text generation, summarization, Q\u0026amp;A, and chatbot applications. The AI Ecosystem on AWS Amazon Bedrock: A hub of leading foundation models from AWS partners (AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI,\u0026hellip;) and Amazon models. AWS Specialized AI Services: “Instant-use” AI services optimized for specific tasks without requiring model training: Amazon Rekognition: Object detection, face recognition, emotion detection, celebrity recognition, video analysis – $0.001/image for the first 1M images. Amazon Translate: Real-time multilingual text translation with high accuracy and natural tone. Amazon Textract: Extracts structured information (tables, forms) from scanned documents or PDFs. Amazon Transcribe: Converts speech to text. Amazon Polly: Converts text to speech. Amazon Comprehend: Sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and topic classification. Amazon Kendra: Natural-language search across internal enterprise documents. Amazon Lookout: Detect anomalies in production lines or industrial machinery for predictive maintenance. Amazon Personalize: Real-time recommendation system powered by machine learning. Prompting Technique: Chain of Thought (CoT) Comparison between Standard Prompting and Chain-of-Thought Prompting. CoT guides the model to reason step-by-step for complex logic problems, significantly improving accuracy compared to simply requesting the final result. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) – Technical Core Problem: Addressing hallucinations and lack of updated knowledge in LLMs. Solution: Combine Retrieval from an external Knowledge Base with the Generation capability of LLMs. Data Ingestion Process: Raw Data (New data) → Chunking. Processed through an Embeddings model (e.g., Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2.0). Stored as vectors in a Vector Store (OpenSearch Serverless, Pinecone, Redis\u0026hellip;). RetrieveAndGenerate API: Manages the entire pipeline from user input → embedding query → retrieving relevant data → augmenting the prompt → generating the final response. What I Learned AI and Cloud Mindset Understand when to use Specialized AI Services for fast, specific tasks and when to use Bedrock/GenAI for creative and complex workloads. Master the design mindset of RAG systems: not just calling LLM APIs, but managing data and vectorization to provide accurate context for AI outputs. Technical Architecture The Chain of Thought technique is key to optimizing model output without fine-tuning. Deep understanding of Amazon Titan Embeddings V2.0 and its role in converting multilingual text into vectors (supports 100+ languages, flexible vector sizes 256/512/1024). Application to Work Applying Amazon Bedrock to the current project: Amazon Rekognition: Identify food items from images to auto-fill calorie information. Amazon Comprehend: Analyze text to standardize food names and store calorie data. Experiment with RAG in the ongoing project. Use Bedrock Agents to orchestrate tasks such as querying food items from a vector store, calculating calorie goals, and generating daily meal plans. Experience at the Event Joining the workshop “Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock” provided a very practical perspective on building modern AI applications, from foundational theory to real-world implementation.\nHands-on Knowledge from Experts Speakers clearly explained the data flow in a RAG system, helping me visualize the “black box” behind modern chatbot applications. The distinction between Traditional ML and Generative AI helped reshape my strategy for choosing technologies in future projects. Technology Experience Impressed by RetrieveAndGenerate API in Bedrock as it eliminates much manual work in linking Vector Stores with LLMs. Saw the power of Amazon Titan Embedding in supporting multilingual applications, making it very suitable for the Vietnamese market. Key Takeaways RAG is the new standard: For AI to work in enterprises, RAG is essential for accuracy and data security. Full ecosystem: AWS provides everything from infrastructure (Vector Store) to models (Bedrock) and application-level orchestration (Agents), significantly accelerating implementation. Some Photos from the Event Overall, the event not only delivered technical knowledge but also helped reshape my mindset about application design, system modernization, and effective collaboration among teams.\n"},{"uri":"https://xchilryhkang.github.io/AWS_Intern_Worklog/","title":"Internship Report","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Internship Report Student Information: Full Name: Nguyen Quoc Bao\nPhone Number: 0969197845\nEmail: baonqse181700@fpt.edu.vn\nUniversity: FPT University\nMajor: Artificial Intelligence\nStudent ID: SE181700\nInternship Company: Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.\nInternship Position: FCJ Cloud Intern\nInternship Duration: From 08/09/2025 to 08/12/2025\nReport Content Worklog Proposal Translated Blogs Events Participated Workshop Self-evaluation Sharing and Feedback "},{"uri":"https://xchilryhkang.github.io/AWS_Intern_Worklog/5-workshop/5.1-workshop-overview/","title":"Introduction","tags":[],"description":"","content":"VPC endpoints VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability.

Executive Summary FoodMind Recommender Platform is an intelligent web platform designed to serve as a personalized eating assistant. It automatically calculates the user\u0026rsquo;s Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) based on their profile and leverages AWS Bedrock (Generative AI) to allow users to log meals in natural language (e.g., “I just ate a bowl of beef pho”).\nThe system also provides intelligent meal recommendations (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner) by automatically filtering dishes according to calorie goals and health constraints (e.g., “allergies”, “gout”).\nThe entire solution is built on a serverless architecture with AWS Amplify (Frontend), API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB (Backend). It enables users to receive meal recommendations based on their calculated calorie intake for the day. Data is stored and queried through Amazon DynamoDB, ensuring high performance and flexible scalability.\nThe solution emphasizes the combination of AI and real-world data to support smart meal decision-making and offers a dashboard for users to track their eating habits effectively.\n2. Problem Statement Current Problem\nMany users struggle to manage their daily diet — they don’t know how many calories to consume or which foods suit their daily health goals. Manual logging and nutritional lookup are time-consuming, inaccurate, and not personalized.\nSolution\nFoodMind Recommender Platform applies AI and AWS Cloud to automate the entire meal tracking and recommendation process:\nGoal Automation: Automatically calculates calorie targets (using the Mifflin-St Jeor formula) when users update their profiles.\nRecommendation Automation: Provides a GET /recommendations API using Lambda business logic to filter dishes from the database based on calorie targets (e.g., lunch \u0026lt; 700 calories) and health restrictions (e.g., avoid “red meat” for gout).\nAI Logging Automation: Provides a POST /log-food API using AWS Bedrock to parse natural language input, extract calories, and store logs.\nSelf-learning Automation: When users log a new dish (e.g., “bun dau mam tom”) unknown to the system, AWS Bedrock estimates its calories and automatically adds it to the knowledge base.\nVisual Tracking: The dashboard (Amplify) displays a 7-day meal history, helping users monitor and manage their dietary habits.\nUsers simply input data — the system understands, analyzes, and recommends suitable meals tailored to personal health goals.\nBenefits and ROI\nSaves time on nutrition tracking, eliminates manual work. Offers highly personalized AI experience. Creates a structured dataset for AI research in food and nutrition. Low cost thanks to serverless architecture. Scalable and reusable for other health-related applications. ROI estimate: payback within 6 months through reduced development time and model reuse. Estimated cost: around 10–15 USD/month. 3. Solution Architecture The platform is fully built on AI-as-a-Service combined with AWS Serverless, ensuring high performance, security, and scalability. Nutritional data on dishes is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, which supports generating meal recommendations based on calculated calorie targets. Amazon Bedrock processes user natural language to extract calorie information and log meals in DynamoDB. AWS Amplify hosts the Next.js web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure user authentication. The architecture is detailed below:\nAWS Services Used\nAWS Amplify: Deploys and hosts the web interface (Next.js), integrates with GitLab CI/CD for auto build and deploy. Amazon Route 53 + AWS WAF + Amazon CloudFront: Edge layer for secure and fast content delivery worldwide. Amazon Cognito: Manages user authentication, login, and access control. Amazon API Gateway: Provides endpoints for GET /Recommendation, POST /Log, GET /Dashboard, connected to Lambda. AWS Lambda (Private Subnet): Handles business logic, calls Bedrock and DynamoDB via VPC Endpoints for security. AWS Bedrock: Generates dish descriptions, normalizes meal logs, and stores them in DynamoDB for personalized recommendations. Amazon DynamoDB: Stores user data, meal logs, calorie goals, and recommendation data with scalable performance. AWS Secrets Manager: Secures credentials (API Keys, Bedrock access) for Lambda and backend. Amazon CloudWatch \u0026amp; AWS CloudTrail: Monitors logs, access, and performance; supports incident recovery. Amazon S3: Stores system logs and backups. AWS IAM: Manages detailed access permissions between services and users. Amazon VPC: Isolates Lambda in a private subnet to ensure secure internal communication between Lambda, DynamoDB, and Bedrock. Component Design\nUser Management: Amazon Cognito controls user access. Content Delivery \u0026amp; Security: Route 53 routes domain, WAF prevents web attacks (SQL Injection, DDoS), CloudFront speeds up global delivery. Web Interface: Amplify hosts the Next.js app. Meal Logging \u0026amp; Recommendation: User input (text) stored in DynamoDB; Lambda recommends dishes based on calorie calculations. Meal Analysis: Lambda calls Bedrock to process user input, extract calorie data, and log new dishes in DynamoDB if missing. Dashboard Display: Amplify shows calorie charts by day/week/month. Authentication \u0026amp; Security: Cognito ensures secure login and user management. Monitoring \u0026amp; Tracking: CloudWatch monitors logs and Lambda performance; CloudTrail records API and user activity history. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases\nResearch \u0026amp; Design: Build AI + Cloud pipeline, check feasibility, and design AWS architecture (Weeks 1–5). Cost Optimization: Validate AWS service pricing to optimize budget (Week 6). Development \u0026amp; Deployment: Load initial data, build Next.js frontend, test APIs, and deploy final product (Weeks 7–11). Technical Requirements\nCalorie Dataset: Collect initial data and load into DynamoDB using AWS SDK (Boto3). Recommendation Platform: Requires knowledge of AWS Amplify (Next.js hosting), S3, Cognito, and Serverless stack (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway), DynamoDB schema (PK, SK), and Bedrock API integration. 5. Roadmap \u0026amp; Milestones Internship (Jan–Mar): January: Learn and master AWS services. February: Design and refine architecture. March: Deploy, test, and launch the system. Post-deployment: Maintain, enhance recommendations, and expand data within one year. 6. Budget Estimation Cost reference: AWS Pricing Calculator\nOr download budget estimation file.\nInfrastructure Cost\nAWS Amplify: 0.50 USD/month (~100 MB, low traffic). AWS Lambda: 0.20–0.30 USD/month (100,000 requests/month, avg runtime \u0026lt;1s). Amazon API Gateway: 0.10–0.20 USD/month (50,000 REST API requests/month). Amazon DynamoDB (Paid Plan): ~0.30 USD/month (50 MB data, ~20,000 requests/month, On-Demand). Amazon S3 (log/backup): 0.10 USD/month (\u0026lt;2GB). AWS Bedrock: 3.00–5.00 USD/month (a few thousand tokens/month). CloudWatch + CloudTrail + IAM: ~0.10 USD/month. Amazon Cognito: 0.00 USD/month (\u0026lt;50 active users, Free Tier).

Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"},{"uri":"https://xchilryhkang.github.io/AWS_Intern_Worklog/1-worklog/1.10-week10/","title":"Week 10 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 10 Objectives: Connect and get acquainted with members of First Cloud Journey.

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services.

These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section).

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution.

The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud.
