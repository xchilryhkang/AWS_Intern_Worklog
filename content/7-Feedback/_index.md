>Here you can freely share your personal experiences participating in the First Cloud Journey program and provide feedback to help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings in the following areas:

### General Feedback

**1. Work Environment**  
The work environment is friendly and open. FCJ team members are always ready to support when difficulties arise, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, which helps me focus better. It could be enhanced with more team bonding or networking activities to help everyone understand each other better.

**2. Mentor / Team Admin Support**  
Mentors provide detailed guidance, clear explanations when something is unclear, and always encourage questions. Team admins assist with procedures, documentation, and ensure smooth workflow. I highly appreciate that mentors allow me to try and resolve issues independently rather than just giving answers.

**3. Relevance to Field of Study**  
The tasks assigned match the knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to strengthen foundational knowledge while acquiring practical skills.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
During the internship, I gained new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Mentors also shared practical experiences, helping me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but remains friendly. During urgent projects, everyone collaborates and supports one another regardless of their role. This made me feel part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Intern Policies / Benefits**  
The company provides internship allowances and flexible working hours when needed. Participating in internal training sessions is also a major plus.
