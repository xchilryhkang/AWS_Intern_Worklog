## Summary of Achievements in Week 10

This week focused on **system monitoring and activity management on AWS**, combining hands-on practice with CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Amplify:

### **Amazon CloudWatch**
- Learned to use **Metrics** to monitor resources such as EC2, Lambda, and DynamoDB.  
- Configured **Logs** for detailed tracking of application and infrastructure activities.  
- Created **Alarms** to notify when thresholds are breached or issues occur.  
- Designed **Dashboards** for an overview of AWS resources.  
- Utilized **X-Ray** for debugging and performance analysis of Lambda functions and API Gateway.

### **AWS CloudTrail**
- Learned how to record all API calls and monitor Read/Write events.  
- Used CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activities within the system.  
- Integrated with CloudWatch to generate alerts and automate responses for critical events.

### **AWS Amplify**
- Quickly hosted frontend and backend applications.  
- Implemented authentication and storage to integrate with Lambda and DynamoDB.  
- Monitored application performance via CloudWatch Logs and X-Ray.

### **Additional Skills**
- Managed IAM Roles & Policies for proper security and access control.  
- Combined CLI and Console for simultaneous management of multiple AWS resources.  
- Planned and executed resource cleanup after practice to optimize costs.

Through Week 10, I developed the ability to **monitor AWS systems in real-time, debug serverless applications, create alerts and dashboards**, and efficiently manage frontend/backend resources using Amplify.
