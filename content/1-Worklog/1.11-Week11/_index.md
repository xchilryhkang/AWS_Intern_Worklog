## Summary of Achievements in Week 11

This week focused on **CI/CD deployment, Elastic Beanstalk, and hands-on experience with AWS AI services**, with the following highlights:

### **AWS CI/CD**
- Understood automated software development processes using **CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline**.  
- Learned how to manage source code, build, test, and deploy applications automatically.

### **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- Deployed web applications quickly on a managed environment.  
- Created and updated stacks using CloudFormation, connected EC2 instances and databases.  
- Monitored environment health and queried server information.

### **Amazon AI Services**
- **Amazon Polly**: Convert text to speech, generate speech marks, integrate with DynamoDB.  
- **Amazon Rekognition**: Detect objects, recognize faces, and test “find a person” application.  
- Configured Cognito Identity Pool to manage user access permissions.

### **Additional Skills**
- Managed IAM Roles & Policies to grant proper permissions for services.  
- Used both Console and CLI for managing, testing, and cleaning up AWS resources.  
- Learned to combine CI/CD, compute, and AI services to deploy end-to-end applications.

Through Week 11, I developed the ability to **deploy web applications using CI/CD, explore pre-trained AI services, and manage the full pipeline from code to deployment**, while also practicing monitoring and securing AWS resources.
