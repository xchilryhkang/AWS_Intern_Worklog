## Summary of Achievements in Week 9

This week focused on the **AWS data ecosystem and Machine Learning**, combining both theoretical learning and hands-on practice with pre-built AI services:

### **AWS Glue, Athena, and QuickSight**
- Understood how Glue Crawler automatically discovers and catalogs data from S3.  
- Used Athena to query S3 data directly using SQL.  
- Visualized data with QuickSight, creating dynamic reports and dashboards.

### **Amazon SageMaker**
- Created and used SageMaker Studio to prepare datasets, train, and tune ML models.  
- Learned the workflow from raw data to model training, evaluation, and exporting results.  
- Practiced deploying models and testing performance, including automated hyperparameter tuning.

### **Amazon Bedrock and Pre-trained AI Services**
- Learned to use Foundation Models, Bedrock Agents, and Knowledge Bases.  
- Understood Bedrock inference features for rapid AI deployment.  
- Explored pre-built AI services:  
  - **Rekognition**: image and video recognition.  
  - **Translate & Transcribe**: translation and speech-to-text.  
  - **Textract & Comprehend**: data extraction and language analysis.  
  - **Polly**: text-to-speech synthesis.  
  - **Kendra & Lookout**: information search and anomaly detection.  
  - **Personalize**: personalized recommendation systems.

### **Additional Skills**
- Managed IAM Roles, Policies, and access rights for secure ML data handling.  
- Connected data across S3, Glue, SageMaker, and QuickSight to build complete data pipelines.  
- Cleaned up resources after practice sessions to optimize costs.

Through Week 9, I gained the ability to **deploy data and ML pipelines on AWS**, understand how to integrate services for analysis, visualization, and ML model deployment, and become familiar with pre-built AI services to accelerate intelligent application development.
