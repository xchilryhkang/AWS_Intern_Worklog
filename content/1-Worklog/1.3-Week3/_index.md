## Summary of Achievements in Week 3

During the third week, I focused on gaining in-depth knowledge of the EC2 service, which is a key component in deploying server infrastructure on AWS. Through both theoretical study and hands-on practice, I gained a clearer understanding of EC2 architecture as well as how to select appropriate instance configurations for different usage requirements. I was able to distinguish between common instance families such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and storage-optimized instances.

In addition, I understood the roles of AMI, key pairs, EBS, and instance store in the process of launching and operating virtual servers. The use of user data and metadata also helped me automate the environment setup process immediately when EC2 instances are initialized. I further explored EFS and FSx to serve the needs of shared storage and data access across multiple servers.

From a practical perspective, I successfully deployed and connected to EC2 servers on both Windows and Linux operating systems. I learned how to create snapshots to back up data and restore it when necessary, as well as how to install basic web applications for testing purposes. By using tags and resource groups, I was able to manage cloud resources in a more structured and systematic manner. At the same time, through IAM, I learned how to restrict access permissions to ensure system security.

In terms of monitoring, I studied and applied Amazon CloudWatch to track system operations. I configured EC2 monitoring metrics, collected application logs, created alarms when CPU usage or network traffic exceeded defined thresholds, and built consolidated dashboards to visually monitor the overall system status.

Regarding scalability, I gained a clear understanding of how EC2 Auto Scaling works, including manual scaling, scheduled scaling, and automatic scaling based on real-time workloads. I also successfully deployed an Auto Scaling Group integrated with a Load Balancer to ensure that the system can automatically adjust the number of running instances based on traffic fluctuations.

At the end of the week, I further explored Amazon Lightsail, a simplified platform for rapid deployment of common applications. I practiced deploying several models such as a WordPress website, a PrestaShop e-commerce system, and the Akaunting accounting software. In addition, I used Lightsail Database for data storage, Lightsail Load Balancer for traffic distribution, created snapshots for backup purposes, and performed instance configuration upgrades when required.

Through the activities completed in Week 3, I gained a solid understanding of the process of deploying, operating, monitoring, and scaling server systems on AWS. This has provided me with a strong foundation to continue learning and implementing real-world cloud systems in the following stages.
