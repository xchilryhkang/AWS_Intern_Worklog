**Welcome to Bao Nguyen’s WorkShop**

Welcome to my worklog – a personal journey with AWS **"The First Cloud Journey".**

This space captures my 12-week path of learning, experimenting, and building with Amazon Web Services.

From the very first steps of exploring the fundamentals to diving into hands-on projects, this worklog reflects how I started my journey “into the cloud.” It is not only a record of tasks and achievements, but also a story of growth, challenges, and discoveries along the way.
