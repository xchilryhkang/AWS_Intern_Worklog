### General Remarks

Throughout the 12-week internship, I have:

* Accumulated a **solid foundational knowledge of AWS**, covering Compute, Storage, Networking, Databases, and supporting services.  
* Learned to deploy and manage resources effectively, combining **Console** and **CLI** usage.  
* Practiced projects ranging from **Serverless, CloudFormation, CDK, EC2, RDS, DynamoDB** to AI and Machine Learning services.  
* Gained experience in a real-world environment at FCJ, collaborating with team members, and understanding rules, regulations, and internship procedures.  

These experiences have provided a strong foundation for deploying more complex cloud projects in the future, while enhancing skills in managing, monitoring, and optimizing AWS infrastructure.
