### Configuring Memory in AgentCore

To enable memory for AgentCore, follow the steps below.

## 1. Create Memory in Bedrock

1. Go to **Bedrock** → select **AgentCore**.
2. Switch to the **Memory** tab.
3. Click **Create memory**.

In the memory creation interface, you will see the following sections:

### Memory name

Set the name for the memory that AgentCore will use.

### Short-term memory (raw event) expiration

The number of days detailed conversation history is stored.
For this demo, you can keep the default **90 days**.

## 2. Types of Memory in AgentCore

### 1. Summarization – Conversation Summaries

**Function:** Summarizes the conversation after it ends or periodically.
**Purpose:** Keeps long-term context while using minimal storage.

**Example:**
You have 100 messages about AWS CLI errors → later the Agent remembers:

> “The user was experiencing AWS CLI connection issues.”

### 2. Semantic Memory

**Function:** Stores key facts or knowledge independent of context.
**Purpose:** Used to answer questions based on previously mentioned information.

**Example:**

> “Project A uses Python 3.9.”
> Ask again later → Agent responds with **Python 3.9** immediately.

### 3. User Preferences

**Function:** Learns user habits and communication style.
**Purpose:** Personalizes responses.

**Example:**
If you often say:

> “Keep the answer short.”
> The Agent will consistently respond concisely.

### 4. Episodes

**Function:** Stores sequences of events and analyzes success/failure through Reflections.
**Purpose:** Helps the Agent learn from past experiences.

**Example:**
A previous flight booking failed due to missing dates → the Agent remembers.
Next time, it asks for the date first.

## 3. Memory Type Used in the Demo

For the demo, you only need:

### Summarization

Choose **Summarization** and click **Create** to complete the setup.

## 4. Update Memory ID in Python

After creating a Memory, you will receive a **Memory ID**.

Add it to your Python file:

```python
# AgentCore Memory Configuration
REGION = "ap-southeast-1"
MEMORY_ID = "memory_j98zj-4LFDxqB2o1"
GROQ_API_KEY = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
```

Be sure to update the **Memory ID** and **Region** to match your configuration.
