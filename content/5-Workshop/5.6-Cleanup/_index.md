Congratulations on completing this workshop! 
In this workshop, you learned architecture patterns for accessing Amazon S3 without using the Public Internet. 
+ By creating a gateway endpoint, you enabled direct communication between EC2 resources and Amazon S3, without traversing an Internet Gateway. 
+ By creating an interface endpoint you extended S3 connectivity to resources running in your on-premises data center via AWS Site-to-Site VPN or Direct Connect.
