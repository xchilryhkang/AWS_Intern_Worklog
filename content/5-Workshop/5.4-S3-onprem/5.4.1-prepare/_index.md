To prepare for this part of the workshop you will need to:
+ Deploying a CloudFormation stack 
+ Modifying a VPC route table. 

These components work together to simulate on-premises DNS forwarding and name resolution.

#### Deploy the CloudFormation stack

The CloudFormation template will create additional services to support an on-premises simulation:
+ One Route 53 Private Hosted Zone that hosts Alias records for the PrivateLink S3 endpoint
+ One Route 53 Inbound Resolver endpoint that enables "VPC Cloud" to resolve inbound DNS resolution requests to the Private Hosted Zone
+ One Route 53 Outbound Resolver endpoint that enables "VPC On-prem" to forward DNS requests for S3 to "VPC Cloud"

1. Click the following link to open the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/reinvent-endpoints-builders-session/R53CF.yaml&stackName=PLOnpremSetup). The required template will be pre-loaded into the menu. Accept all default and click Create stack.

It may take a few minutes for stack deployment to complete. You can continue with the next step without waiting for the deployemnt to finish.

#### Update on-premise private route table

This workshop uses a strongSwan VPN running on an EC2 instance to simulate connectivty between an on-premises datacenter and the AWS cloud. Most of the required components are provisioned before your start. To finalize the VPN configuration, you will modify the "VPC On-prem" routing table to direct traffic destined for the cloud to the strongSwan VPN instance.

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console 

2. Select the instance named infra-vpngw-test. From the Details tab, copy the Instance ID and paste this into your text editor

3. Navigate to the VPC menu by using the Search box at the top of the browser window.

4. Click on Route Tables, select the RT Private On-prem route table, select the Routes tab, and click Edit Routes.

5. Click Add route.
+ Destination: your Cloud VPC cidr range
+ Target: ID of your infra-vpngw-test instance (you saved in your editor at step 1)
