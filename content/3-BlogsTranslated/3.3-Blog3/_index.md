# Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Using Microservices

Data lakes can help hospitals and healthcare facilities turn data into business insights, maintain business continuity, and protect patient privacy. A **data lake** is a centralized, managed, and secure repository to store all your data, both in its raw and processed forms for analysis. Data lakes allow you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and make better business decisions.

This blog post is part of a larger series on getting started with setting up a healthcare data lake. In my final post of the series, *“Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Diving into Amazon Cognito”*, I focused on the specifics of using Amazon Cognito and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to authenticate and authorize users in the healthcare data lake solution. In this blog, I detail how the solution evolved at a foundational level, including the design decisions I made and the additional features used. You can access the code samples for the solution in this Git repo for reference.

## Architecture Guidance

The main change since the last presentation of the overall architecture is the decomposition of a single service into a set of smaller services to improve maintainability and flexibility. Integrating a large volume of diverse healthcare data often requires specialized connectors for each format; by keeping them encapsulated separately as microservices, we can add, remove, and modify each connector without affecting the others. The microservices are loosely coupled via publish/subscribe messaging centered in what I call the “pub/sub hub.”

This solution represents what I would consider another reasonable sprint iteration from my last post. The scope is still limited to the ingestion and basic parsing of **HL7v2 messages** formatted in **Encoding Rules 7 (ER7)** through a REST interface.

**The solution architecture is now as follows:**

While the term *microservices* has some inherent ambiguity, certain traits are common:  
- Small, autonomous, loosely coupled  
- Reusable, communicating through well-defined interfaces  
- Specialized to do one thing well  
- Often implemented in an **event-driven architecture**

When determining where to draw boundaries between microservices, consider:  
- **Intrinsic**: technology used, performance, reliability, scalability  
- **Extrinsic**: dependent functionality, rate of change, reusability  
- **Human**: team ownership, managing *cognitive load*

## Technology Choices and Communication Scope

| Communication scope                       | Technologies / patterns to consider                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Within a single microservice              | Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Step Functions                               |
| Between microservices in a single service | AWS CloudFormation cross-stack references, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) |
| Between services                          | Amazon EventBridge, AWS Cloud Map, Amazon API Gateway                                      |

## The Pub/Sub Hub

Using a **hub-and-spoke** architecture (or message broker) works well with a small number of tightly related microservices.  
- Each microservice depends only on the *hub*  
- Inter-microservice connections are limited to the contents of the published message  
- Reduces the number of synchronous calls since pub/sub is a one-way asynchronous *push*

Drawback: **coordination and monitoring** are needed to avoid microservices processing the wrong message.

## Core Microservice

Provides foundational data and communication layer, including:  
- **Amazon S3** bucket for data  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for data catalog  
- **AWS Lambda** to write messages into the data lake and catalog  
- **Amazon SNS** topic as the *hub*  
- **Amazon S3** bucket for artifacts such as Lambda code

> Only allow indirect write access to the data lake through a Lambda function → ensures consistency.

---

## Front Door Microservice

- Provides an API Gateway for external REST interaction  
- Authentication & authorization based on **OIDC** via **Amazon Cognito**  
- Self-managed *deduplication* mechanism using DynamoDB instead of SNS FIFO because:  
  1. SNS deduplication TTL is only 5 minutes  
  2. SNS FIFO requires SQS FIFO  
  3. Ability to proactively notify the sender that the message is a duplicate

## Staging ER7 Microservice

- Lambda “trigger” subscribed to the pub/sub hub, filtering messages by attribute  
- Step Functions Express Workflow to convert ER7 → JSON  
- Two Lambdas:  
  1. Fix ER7 formatting (newline, carriage return)  
  2. Parsing logic  
- Result or error is pushed back into the pub/sub hub

## New Features in the Solution

### 1. AWS CloudFormation Cross-Stack References
Example *outputs* in the core microservice:
```yaml
Outputs:
  Bucket:
    Value: !Ref Bucket
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Bucket
  ArtifactBucket:
    Value: !Ref ArtifactBucket
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-ArtifactBucket
  Topic:
    Value: !Ref Topic
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Topic
  Catalog:
    Value: !Ref Catalog
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Catalog
  CatalogArn:
    Value: !GetAtt Catalog.Arn
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-CatalogArn
